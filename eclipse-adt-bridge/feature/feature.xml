      Bridges Eclipse ADT (ABAP Development Tools) to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.
      Runs an HTTP server on port 19456 inside Eclipse that proxies SAP ADT REST API
      requests through Eclipse's authenticated session, enabling AI assistants to
      read and write ABAP code.

      Requires SAP ADT (ABAP Development Tools) to be installed in Eclipse.
